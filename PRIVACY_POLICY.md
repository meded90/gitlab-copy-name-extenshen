Privacy Policy

Last updated:  31.01.2025

1. Introduction

The GitLab Copy Task Name extension is designed to help users quickly copy the title and issue number of GitLab tasks. We respect your privacy and ensure that this extension does not collect, store, or share any user data.

2. What data do we collect?

Our extension does not collect any personal data. It operates only within the active GitLab tab and copies issue text without transmitting any information to third parties.

3. How is information used?

Since the extension does not collect any data, it does not process, analyze, or transmit any user information.

4. Permissions and data access

The extension requests only the minimal permissions necessary for its functionality:
•	“scripting” – Required to add a copy button in the GitLab interface.
•	“activeTab” – Grants access to the active tab only after user interaction.
•	“host_permissions” (”:////issues/”) – Limits extension functionality to GitLab issue pages only.

These permissions do not allow the extension to collect or transmit any user data.

5. Data sharing with third parties

We do not share any data with third parties, do not use external services to process information, and do not integrate with remote servers.

6. Security

Since the extension does not process personal data, no special security measures for data storage are required. The source code of the extension is open and can be reviewed by users.

7. Changes to the policy

If this privacy policy changes in the future (for example, if new features are added), users will be notified in advance. However, in its current version, the extension does not collect data, and this principle will remain unchanged.

8. Contact Information
